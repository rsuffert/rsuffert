# Hey there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px" height="30px">

I'm a software developer from Brazil 🇧🇷 who loves exploring new technologies and solving problems. I'm always seeking opportunities to learn, with my main fields of interest being Internet of Things (IoT) 📡, CyberSecurity 🛡️, Computer Networks 🌐, Operating Systems ⚙️, Artificial Intelligence (AI) 🤖, Parallel, Distributed and Cloud Computing 📶, and programming in general 👨‍💻. I'm currently working at [**HP Inc.**](https://www.hp.com) and completing my major in Computer Science at the [**Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS)**](https://www.pucrs.br/en/). Here, you'll find mainly the code for my college assignments and personal projects. I also love coffee ☕️, good food 👨‍🍳, gaming 🎮, movies & series 🎬, dogs 🐶, soccer ⚽, and hiking ⛰️.
